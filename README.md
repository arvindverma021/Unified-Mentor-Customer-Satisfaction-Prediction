This project focuses on analyzing customer support tickets to understand key trends, optimize response times, and improve customer satisfaction. It involves:

Data Exploration & Cleaning:

Loading a dataset of 8,469 support tickets.
Identifying missing values and fixing inconsistencies.
Descriptive Analysis:

Examining ticket status, priority levels, and resolution times.
Understanding which support channels (Email, Phone, Chat, etc.) customers use the most.
Customer Satisfaction Analysis:

Investigating customer ratings (1-5 stars) for resolved tickets.
Checking if faster resolution leads to higher satisfaction (no strong correlation found).
Operational Insights:

Finding bottlenecks in ticket resolution.
Identifying areas for service improvement (e.g., high pending tickets).
Goal of the Project
The project helps customer support teams optimize workflows by identifying trends, improving response efficiency, and enhancing customer experience through data-driven decisions.# Unified-Mentor-Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction
